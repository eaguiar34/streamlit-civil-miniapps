# Streamlit Civil Engineering Mini‑Apps (Uploads + CUI Guardrails)


Two tiny tools that run anywhere:
- **Submittal Checker** — Paste a spec section and a submittal or upload PDF/DOCX/CSV. The app flags likely missing items with simple fuzzy matching.
- **Schedule What‑Ifs** — Enter tasks/dependencies (or upload CSV); compute critical path; try fast‑track (overlap) and crash plans with rough cost impacts.


## Local Run
bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
